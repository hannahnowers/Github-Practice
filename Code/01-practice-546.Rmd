head ../Data/Ab_4denovo_CLC6_a.fa #asking it to print the first 10 lines from the folder, lines starting with (>) are sequence headers
echo "How many sequences are there?" #echo prints the follow line into terminal, this labels the ouput so you know what the number refers to
grep -c ">" ../Data/Ab_4denovo_CLC6_a.fa # grep-> searches for patterns in a file, -c -> counts the number of lines that match, ">" looks for the > characters(FASTA headings), Ab_4denovo_CLC6_a.fa is telling it which files to search. Overall, looking for the number of lines that start with > which tells it the number of sequences
